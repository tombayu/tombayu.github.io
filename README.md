# Hello, welcome to my site.
My name is Tombayu. I am a world citizen. I was born in France, spent most of my life (up to date) in Indonesia, and currently live and work in the Netherlands.
I have a broad range of interest. Keywords: maps, (spatial) data science, public transportation, Indonesian-Dutch history, food, language, cultural assimilation. See the range? If you happen to have the same interest, let's catch up!

Cheers!
