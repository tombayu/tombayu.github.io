# Hello, welcome to my site.
My name is Tombayu. I am a world citizen. I was born in France, spent most of my life (up to date) in Indonesia, and currently live and work in the Netherlands.
I have a broad range of interest. Keywords: maps, (spatial) data science, public transportation, Indonesian-Dutch history, food, language, cultural assimilation. See the range? If you happen to have the same interest, let's catch up!

The [portfolio](tombayu.github.io/portfolio) lists the (personal and work-related) projects I have done.
In [Github](github.com/tombayu) I post the codes I wrote.
I consider my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tombayu-amadeo-hidayat/) as my professional profile.
I do write (spatial) data science stuffs in [Medium](medium.com/@tombayu).
For a daily story and writings, you can visit my [tumblr](tom5ive.tumblr.com).
I spam a lot of stuffs in [Twitter](twitter.com/tom5ive).
My [Instagram](instagram.com/tombayu) is rather personal.
And, all in all, I am always reachable in my email htombayu(at)gmail(dot)com

## Cheers!
